<p>As proud users and developers of WordPress, giving back to the community is important to us. We have done this already by creating free plugins that are well maintained and supported, but we wanted to do a little more than that. We feel that WordCamps and meetups are a vital part of bringing the community together, to share knowledge and to help others. </p>
<p>In that light, we are very proud to tell you that we are sponsoring this year's WordCamp Netherlands.</p>
