<p>I'm very happy to announce that I will be representing ibericode during <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/">this year's WordCamp Europe</a> in Seville, Spain (for which we are a small sponsor as well). It's the perfect place to talk to you about our existing plugins, the changes we're working on and to answer any questions you might be having.</p>
<p>For example: did you know that we are working on an improved WooCommerce integration for our <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress plugin</a>? Make sure to ask me about it when we meet!</p>

<h2>Let's play a game!</h2>
<p>I would like to invite you, fellow WordCamp goer, to a little game. We figured it would be a fun way to get to know you a little better and to introduce our new name to you. Here are the rules:</p>
<p><img src="{{site.url}}/media/ibericode-shirt_1024-150x150.jpg" alt="Ines in ibericode shirt" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-67" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Find me during WordCamp Europe. I will be wearing a white t-shirt with the ibericode logo on it so I'll be easy to spot, and I'll be around all three days (including Contributor Day).</li>
  <li>Take a selfie with me. Make sure the ibericode logo is clearly visible in your picture!</li>
  <li>Tweet your photo using <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ibericode" target="_blank">@ibericode</a> and the hashtag <strong>#WCEU</strong>. Make sure to give us a follow too!</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! The first 20 people to take a selfie with me and tweet it, will be declared a winner. And what do winners get? Prizes, of course!</p>

<h2>What's there to win?</h2>
<p>We're going to be very generous here. Each person that is declared a winner by us gets <strong>a free single site MailChimp for WordPress license</strong>. You read that right! You'll get a full year of Pro support and access to the newest features. All that, just by saying hi! :)</p>
<p>For those of you that already have a plugin license (thank you!), we will extend it for one year or give you an additional site activation, whichever you prefer!</p>
<p><strong>See you in Sevilla!</strong></p>
<p>(PS. For the sake of clarity, here's a little disclaimer: the free license you'll receive is valid for one year only. After a year you will need to renew if you want to keep on receiving plugin updates. Not to worry though: renewal costs are very reasonable and we'll send you a timely reminder so you have time to consider.)</p>
