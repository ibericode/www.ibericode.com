<p>It's been nearly two years since the first release of the MailChimp for WordPress plugin, and it's been a crazy ride. We've surpassed one million downloads, there are over 200k active installs and the team has grown by a few hands. A whopping 367 users have left us a 5-star rating. It's safe to say we can be proud of all the accomplishments.</p>
<p>But it's not just the <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress plugin</a> that we develop and give support on. There are quite a few others, and it's high time you knew about them. <a href="https://scrolltriggeredboxes.com/">Scroll Triggered Boxes</a> is growing by the day, in both downloads and improvements.  And since it's not just Danny in the "Danny van Kooten" team any more, a change of name seemed fitting.</p>
<p>We've thought long and hard on what this overarching name should be. In the end, <strong>ibericode</strong> was chosen because it combines the love the team bears for both good food (the Iberico pig is very yummy) and well-written code. And don't worry: the name might have changed, but we will continue to give you the level of support that you're used to receiving from us.</p>
<p>With a new name also comes a brand spanking new logo and a mascot we've lovingly called <strong>Rico</strong>. </p>

<p>Do you like him as much as we do? We'd love to hear your opinion! </p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we'll be adding quite a few things. There will be blogs that will help you get the most out of our plugins, new features that we can't wait to tell you about and maybe even a contest&hellip; You never know!</p>
